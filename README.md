# AllLife Bank - Personal Loan Prediction

## Context
AllLife Bank, a US-based financial institution, has a growing customer base, primarily consisting of **liability customers** (depositors). However, the number of **borrowers** (asset customers) is relatively small. The bank aims to expand its loan business by converting more depositors into **personal loan customers** while ensuring they remain depositors.  

A previous marketing campaign targeting liability customers achieved a **conversion rate of over 9%**, motivating the **retail marketing department** to develop more targeted campaigns to improve this success rate.  

As a **Data Scientist** at AllLife Bank, your task is to build a predictive model that helps the marketing team identify **potential customers** who are most likely to purchase a personal loan.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to:  
- **Predict** whether a liability customer will purchase a personal loan.  
- **Identify** key customer attributes that influence loan purchases.  
- **Segment** customers to improve targeted marketing strategies.

## Data Description
The dataset contains information about customers, including their demographics, financial history, and loan purchase behavior.

## Getting Started
To analyze and build a predictive model, follow these steps:

1. **Load the dataset** into a data analysis environment (e.g., Python, Jupyter Notebook).
2. **Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns and insights.
3. **Preprocess the data** (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize features, etc.).
4. **Build and evaluate machine learning models** to predict loan purchases.
5. **Interpret the results** and provide insights for the marketing team.
